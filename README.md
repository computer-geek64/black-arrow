# Black Arrow

A cross-platform reverse shell using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for breaching highly secure firewalls and evading aggressive antivirus programs. This is a payload to be used as a last resort, when all other live or non-automated payloads have failed to establish themselves successfully, hence the name "Black Arrow" (last arrow). This can also be used as a tool for IT automation or quick data exfiltration, considering its OS-independent features.
